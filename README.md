# IG2GD
converts the impossible game level data to geometry dash.

# Set Up
If this is your first time using this tool. Then follow these steps:
- Download the repository
- Install the required modules (if necessary)
- Run the tool once to make the input and output directories
- Insert level data into the input directory (.dat for Impossible Game 1) (.json for Impossible Game 2)
- Run the tool again and you'll recieve a plist file of the level data converted to Geometry Dash.
- Insert the level data (plist) to any file that you want to test on (ex: LevelData.plist or decrypt the save file and insert level data there)
- Run geometry dash and your level should be in the game.
Enjoy ;)

# Development
- Note that some of the objects are either buggy or not included in Geometry Dash and will then have to manually edit some of the parts. So be aware that there will be updates coming soon.
